xv (3.10a-11) non-free; urgency=low

  * After some discussions with the mime-support maintainer, xv should
    always remove the MIME types when desintalling (even upgrading) and
    reask them when installing (even) upgrading.
    This release brings us back to 3.10a-9 basically.
  * Popped the libtiff version in the shlibs.local from 034 to 035.
  * Added the libjpeg6a in shlibs.local as the provided shlib fails to add
    the dependency.
