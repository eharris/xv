<h1>Modifying <em>xv</em> Behavior</h1>

<p><i>xv</i> supports literally dozens of command line options
and X11 resources. Fortunately, it is doubtful that you'll ever
need to use more than a small few. The rest are provided mainly
for that 'one special case' application of <i>xv</i>... Note that
you do not have to specify the entire option name, only enough
characters to uniquely identify the option. Thus, '<tt>-geom</tt>'
is a fine abbreviation of '<tt>-geometry</tt>'.</p>

<h2><a name="command-line-options-overview">Command Line Options
Overview</a></h2>

<p>If you start <i>xv</i> with the command '<tt>xv -help</tt>',
the current (wildly out of control) list of options will be
displayed:</p>

<p>Yes, as a matter of fact, I <i>am</i> a little embarrassed
about it.</p>

<p>One big change starting in <i>xv </i>3.10: In the past, most
of the command-line options were <i>toggles</i>, in that they
would normally turn some feature on, but if you had an X resource
that also turned that feature on, then they would turn that
feature <i>off. </i>Now, they are absolute settings. For
instance, '<tt>-rv'</tt> turns on reverse video mode, regardless
of the setting of the '<tt>xv.reverse'</tt> resource, and '<tt>+rv'</tt>
turns <i>off</i> reverse video mode, regardless of the setting of
the '<tt>xv.reverse'</tt> resource. (Thanks Peder!)</p>

<h2><a name="sizing-options">Image Sizing Options</a></h2>

<dl>
    <dt><a name="geometry"><b>-ge</b><tt>ometry</tt> <i>geom</i></a></dt>
    <dd>Lets you specify the size and placement of the 'image'
		window. It's most useful when you only specify a
		position, and let <i>xv</i> choose the size. If you
		specify a size as well, <i>xv</i> will create a window of
		that size, unless <tt>-fixed</tt> is specified. The geom
		argument is in the form of a normal X geometry string
		(e.g. &quot;300x240&quot; or &quot;+10+10&quot; or
		&quot;400x300+10+10&quot;) </dd>
    <dd>(Resource name: <tt>geometry</tt> . Type: string)</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="fixed"><b>-</b>/<b>+fi</b><tt>xed</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Only used in conjunction with the <tt>-geometry</tt>
		option. If you specify a window size with the <tt>-geometry</tt>
		option, <i>xv</i> will normally stretch the picture to
		exactly that size. This is not always desirable, as it
		may seriously distort the aspect ratio of the picture.
		Specifying the <tt>-fixed</tt> option corrects this
		behavior by instructing <i>xv</i> to use the specified
		geometry size as a maximum window size. It will preserve
		the original aspect ratio of the picture. ( <tt>+fixed</tt>
		turns off this feature, forcing the image to be exactly
		the size specified by the <tt>-geometry</tt> option.) <p>For
		example, if you give a rectangular geometry of '320x240',
		and you try to display a square picture with a size of
		'256x256', the window opened will actually be '240x240',
		which is the largest square that still fits in the
		'320x240' rectangle that was specified.</p>
		<p>(Resource name: <tt>fixed</tt> . Type: boolean)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="expand"><b>-e</b><tt>xpand</tt> <i>exp</i></a></dt>
    <dd>Lets you specify an initial expansion or compression
		factor for the picture. You can specify floating-point
		values. Values larger than zero multiply the picture's
		dimensions by the given factor. (i.e., an expand factor
		of '3' will make a 320x200 image display as 960x600). <p>Factors
		less than zero are treated as reciprocals. (i.e., an
		expand factor of '-4' makes the picture 1/4 th its normal
		size.). '0' is not a valid expansion factor.</p>
		<p>You can also specify a pair of expansion values,
		separated by a colon, to set different horizontal and
		vertical expansion ratios. For instance, '3:2' would
		expand images 3x horizontally, and 2x vertically.</p>
		<p>(Resource name: <tt>expand</tt> . Type: string) </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="aspect"><b>-as</b><tt>pect</tt> <i>w:h</i></a></dt>
    <dd>Lets you set an initial aspect ratio, and also sets the
		value used by the <b>Aspect</b> command. The aspect ratio
		of nearly every X display (and, in fact, <i>any</i>
		civilized graphics display) is 1:1. What this means is
		that pixels appear to be 'square'. A 100 pixel wide by
		100 pixel high box will appear on the screen as a square.
		Unfortunately, this is not the case with some screens and
		digitizers. The <tt>-aspect</tt> option lets you stretch
		the picture so that the picture appears correctly on your
		display. Unlike the other size- related options, this one
		doesn't care what the size of the overall picture is. It
		operates on a pixel-by-pixel basis, stretching each image
		pixel slightly, in either width or height, depending on
		the ratio. <p>Aspect ratios greater than '1:1' (e.g.,
		'4:3') make the picture wider than normal. Aspect ratios
		less than '1:1' (e.g. '2:3') make the picture taller than
		normal. (Useful aspect ratio: A 512x480 image that was
		supposed to fill a standard 4x3 video screen (produced by
		many video digitizers) should be displayed with an aspect
		ratio of '5:4')</p>
		<p>(Resource name: <tt>aspect</tt> . Type: string)</p>

</dl>

<h2><a name="color-allocation-options">Color Allocation Options</a></h2>

<dl>
    <dt><a name="ncols"><b>-nc</b><tt>ols</tt> <i>nc</i></a></dt>
    <dd>Sets the maximum number of colors that <i>xv</i> will
		use. By default, this is 'as many as it can get'.
		However, you can set this to smaller values for
		interesting effect. If you set it to '0', it will display
		the picture by dithering with 'black' and 'white'. (The
		actual colors used can be set by the <tt>- black</tt> and
		<tt>-white</tt> options, below.) <p>The other major use
		of this option is to limit the number of colors used when
		putting up an image that's going to be hanging around for
		a while. (i.e., an image in the root window) You may want
		to limit the number of colors used for such images so
		that other programs will still have some colorcells
		available for their own use.</p>
		<p>(Resource name: <tt>ncols</tt> . Type: integer)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="rw"><b>-</b>/<b>+rw</b></a></dt>
    <dd>Tells <i>xv</i> to use read/write color cells. Normally, <i>xv</i>
		allocates colors read- only, which allows it to share
		colors with other programs. If you use read/write color
		cells, no other program can use the colors that <i>xv</i>
		is using, and vice-versa. The major reason to do such a
		thing is that using read/write color cells allows the <b>Apply</b>
		function in the <i>xv color editor</i> window to operate
		much faster. ( <tt>+rw</tt> forces <i>xv</i> to use
		read-only color, the default) <p>(Resource name: <tt>rwColor</tt>
		. Type: boolean)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="perfect"><b>-</b>/<b>+pe</b><tt>rfect</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Makes <i>xv</i> try 'extra hard' to get all the colors it
		wants. In particular, when <tt>-perfect</tt> is
		specified, <i>xv</i> will allocate and install its own
		colormap if (and only if) it was unable to allocate all
		the desired colors. This option is not allowed in
		conjunction with the <tt>-root</tt> option. <p>(Resource
		name: <tt>perfect</tt> . Type: boolean)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="owncmap"><b>-</b>/<b>+o</b><tt>wncmap</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Like '<tt>-perfect'</tt>, only this option forces <i>xv</i>
		to always allocate and install its own colormap, thereby
		leaving the default colormap untouched. <p>(Resource
		name: <tt>ownCmap</tt> . Type: boolean)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="stdcmap"><b>-</b>/<b>+st</b><tt>dcmap</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Puts <i>xv</i> into <b>Use Std. Colormap</b> mode. All
		images will be shown dithered using the same set of
		colors. This lets you run multiple copies of <i>xv</i> to
		display multiple images simultaneously, and still have
		enough colors to go around. <p>(Resource name: <tt>useStdCmap</tt>
		. Type: boolean)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="cecmap"><b>-</b>/<b>+cec</b><tt>map</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies whether <i>xv</i> installs the image's colormap
		in the <i>xv color editor</i> window, as well as in the
		image's window. By default, the program does not install
		the colormap in the color editor window, as this often
		makes the color editor window unreadable. Note, however
		that the <i>Colormap Editor</i> tool will be appear
		somewhat misleading. (This option only applies when the '<tt>-perfect'</tt>
		or '<tt>-owncmap'</tt> options create their own
		colormaps.) <p>(Resource name: <tt>ceditColorMap</tt> .
		Type boolean)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="ninstall"><b>-</b>/<b>+ni</b><tt>nstall</tt></a></dt>
    <dd>Prevents <i>xv</i> from 'installing' its own colormap,
		when the <tt>-perfect</tt> or <tt>-owncmap</tt> options
		are in effect. Instead of installing the colormap, it
		will merely 'ask the window manager, nicely' to take care
		of it. This is the correct way to install a colormap
		(i.e., ask the WM to do it), unfortunately, it doesn't
		actually seem to work in many window managers, so the
		default behavior is for <i>xv</i> to handle installation
		itself. However, this has been seen to annoy one window
		manager (<i>dxwm</i>), so this option is provided if your
		WM doesn't like programs installing their own colormaps. <p>(Resource
		name: <tt>ninstall</tt> . Type: boolean)</p>
