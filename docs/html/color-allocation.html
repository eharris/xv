<h1>Color Allocation in <i>xv</i></h1>

<p>Allocating colors on an X11 display is not as trivial a matter
as it might seem on first glance. <i>xv</i> goes to a lot of
trouble to allocate colors from what is essentially a scarce
resource. This appendix is provided for those inquisitive types
who'd be interested in learning how to successfully 'argue' with
an X server.</p>

<p>Note: If you're using a <i>TrueColor</i> display, you can
safely ignore this appendix, as none of the following actually
happens on your system. On a <i>TrueColor</i> system, there is no
colormap. Pixel values directly correspond to displayed color
values. For example, in a typical 24-bit <i>TrueColor</i>
display, each pixel value is a 24-bit unsigned number, which
corresponds to an 8-bit <i>Red</i> component, an 8-bit <i>Green</i>
component, and an 8-bit <i>Blue</i> component, bitwise shifted
and OR-ed together to form a 24-bit number. As a result, all
displayable colors are always available for use.</p>

<h2><a name="problem-with-pseudocolor-displays">The Problem with
PseudoColor Displays</a></h2>

<p>Most color X displays use a 'visual' model called <i>PseudoColor</i>.
On a <i>PseudoColor</i> display, pixel values are small unsigned
integers which point into a 'colormap', which contains an RGB
triple for each possible pixel value. As an example, on a typical
8-bit color X display, pixel values can range between 0 and 255,
inclusive. There is a 256-entry colormap which contains an RGB
triple for each possible pixel value. When the video display
hardware sees a pixel value of '7', for instance, it looks up
color #7 in the colormap, and sends the RGB components found in
that position of the colormap to the video monitor for display.</p>

<p>In the X Window System, entries on the display's colormap
(called colorcells) are a scarce resource. At any time, out of
the 256 colors available (in an 8-bit <i>PseudoColor</i> system),
several of these colors may already be in use by your window
manager, the cursor, and other applications. As such, <i>xv</i>
cannot assume that it has 256 colors at its disposal, because it
generally doesn't.</p>

<p>A word on the <i>xv</i> color allocation policy: The overall
goal is to &quot;make this one image being displayed right now
look as good as possible, without changing the colors of any
other applications.&quot; You can modify this goal slightly to
suit your purposes, on the off chance that your goal isn't the
same as my goal. See &quot;<a
href="control-window-2.html#color-allocation-commands">Color
Allocation Commands</a>&quot; for further details.</p>

<h2><a name="s-default-color-allocation-algorithm"><i>xv</i>'s
Default Color Allocation Algorithm</a></h2>

<p>By default, <i>xv</i> will allocate 'read-only' colorcells.
Since these colorcells cannot be changed by the application, they
can be freely shared among applications. This is the default
behavior because it is the most likely to succeed in getting the
colors it needs. It does, however, slow down any color changes
made in the <i>xv color editor</i> window. If you intend to be
doing any serious color modification, you should probably run <i>xv</i>
with the '<tt>-rw</tt>' option.</p>

<p>When allocating read-only colorcells, <i>xv</i> uses a
four-step process to acquire the colors it wants.</p>

<p>The first step is to sort the desired colors by order of
'importance', so that we ask for the most 'important' colors
first. See &quot;<a href="diversity-algorithm.html">The Diversity
Algorithm</a>&quot; for more details on this step.</p>

<p>The next step (Phase 1 Color Allocation) is to ask for each
color in the list. Colors that we failed to get (presumably
because there are no more entries available in the colormap) are
marked for use in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 Color Allocation steps.</p>

<p>If we successfully allocated all the desired colors in Phase
1, the algorithm exits at this time. Otherwise, it goes on to
Phase 2. In Phase 2, the display's colormap is examined. For each
color that went unallocated in Phase 1, the program looks for the
color in the display's colormap that is the 'nearest' match to
the originally desired color. It then tries to allocate these
'nearest' colors as read-only colorcells. The number of
successful allocations in Phase 2 will be displayed in the string
&quot;Got ## 'close' colors.&quot;, visible in the <i>xv info</i>
window.</p>

<p>If all the colors have been successfully allocated by this
point, the algorithm exits. Otherwise, it continues on the Phase
3. In Phase 3, any colors still unallocated are simply mapped
into the 'nearest' colors that <i>were</i> allocated in Phase 1
or Phase 2.</p>

<h2><a name="perfect-color-allocation">'Perfect' Color Allocation</a></h2>

<p>If you'd like the image displayed &quot;as nicely as possible
on this display, and everything else be damned&quot;, you can run
<i>xv</i> in 'perfect' mode, by specifying the '<tt>-perfect</tt>'
option on the command line.</p>

<p>In 'perfect' mode, color allocation proceeds much like it does
in 'imperfect' mode. The colors are sorted in decreasing order of
'importance'. Each of these colors is then requested, as in the
Phase 1 color allocation code described above.</p>

<p>The big change comes on a failed allocation request. If a
color is not successfully allocated in Phase 1, and this is the
first failed request, we assume that the colormap is full. The
program frees all the colors allocated so far, creates and
installs a completely new colormap. When a new colormap is
installed, everything else on the screen (including other <i>xv</i>
windows) will go to hell. Only the image window will look
correct. Generally, the colormap will remain installed as long as
your mouse is inside the image window. It is, however, up to your
particular window manager to decide how multiple colormaps are
handled..</p>

<p>After the colormap has been installed, the program starts
Phase 1 over again, allocating colors from the new, empty
colormap. If any color allocation requests still fail, they are
marked and dealt with in Phase 2. (It is possible for allocation
requests from the new, empty colormap to fail, as the program may
be asking for more colors than are available in a colormap. For
example, you could be running <i>xv</i> on a 4- or 6-bit display,
which only would have 16 or 64 colors (respectively) in a
colormap.)</p>

<p>Phase 2 operates as described above, except that it looks for
'nearest' matches in the newly created colormap. Also, since xv
already owns every color in this colormap, we don't technically
have to 'allocate' any of them in this Phase. We already have
allocated them once.</p>

<p>Note that 'perfect' mode only creates and installs a new
colormap if it was necessary. If all the Phase 1 color allocation
requests succeeded, a new colormap will not be created.</p>

<h2><a name="allocating-read-write-colors">Allocating Read-Write
Colors</a></h2>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to allocate read-write colorcells
instead of read-only colorcells. Read-write colorcells cannot be
shared among programs. As such, unless you use 'perfect' mode as
well, you are likely to successfully allocate fewer colors.
That's the disadvantage. The advantage is that, since <i>xv</i>
completely owns these colorcells, it can do what it wishes with
them. Color changes (as controlled by the <i>xv color editor</i>
window) will happen almost instantaneously, as the program only
has to store new RGB values in the colorcells, rather than free
all the colors and reallocate new <i>different</i> colors.</p>

<p>To allocate read-write colorcells, start <i>xv</i> with the ' <tt>-rw</tt>
' option. Colorcells are allocated one at a time. If an
allocation request fails, the code stops allocating new
colorcells. (Unless you've also specified 'perfect' mode. In
'perfect' mode, the first time an allocation request fails, all
allocated colors are freed, a new, empty colormap is created and
installed, and all colors are reallocated. If there is an
allocation error in this second pass, the code stops allocating
new colorcells.)</p>

<p>If there are still unallocated color remaining, these colors
are simply mapped into the closest colors that were allocated. </p>

<p>For further information, and actual code that does everything
described in this appendix, see the functions '<tt>AllocROColors()</tt>'
and '<tt>AllocRWColors()</tt>', both of which can be found in the
source module '<tt>xvcolor.c</tt>'. </p>
