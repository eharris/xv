<h1>Adding Other Image Formats to <i>xv</i></h1>

<p>This appendix is split up into two sections, one for reading a
new file format, and the other for writing a new file format.
Note that you do not necessarily have to read <i>and</i> write a
new file format. For example, <i>xv</i> can read PCX files, but
it doesn't write them. Likewise, <i>xv</i> traditionally could
only write PostScript files, but couldn't read them. (And
technically, it still doesn't.)</p>

<p>For the purposes of this example, I'll be talking about the
PBM/PGM/PPM code specifically. (See the file <tt>xvpbm.c</tt> for
full details.)</p>

<h2><a name="writing-code-reading-new-file-format">Writing Code
for Reading a New File Format</a></h2>

<p>Note: Despite the wide variety of displays and file formats <i>xv</i>
can deal with, internally it only manipulates 8-bit colormapped
images or 24-bit RGB images. If you're loading an 8-bit
colormapped image, such as a GIF image, no problem. If you're
loading an 8-or-fewer-bits format that doesn't have a colormap
(such as an 8-bit greyscale image, or a 1-bit B/W bitmap) your <tt>Load</tt>
() routine will have to generate an appropriate colormap.</p>

<p>Make a copy of <tt>xvpbm.c</tt> , calling it something
appropriate. For the rest of this appendix, mentally replace the
string '<tt>xvpbm.c</tt>' with the name of your new file.</p>

<p>Edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> and/or the <tt>Imakefile</tt> so
that your new module will be compiled. In the <tt>Makefile</tt> ,
add &quot;<tt>xvpbm.o</tt>&quot; to the &quot;<tt>OBJS = ...</tt>&quot;
macro definition. In the <tt>Imakefile</tt> , add &quot;<tt>xvpbm.o</tt>&quot;
to the end of the &quot;<tt>OBJS1 = ...</tt>&quot; macro
definition, and &quot;<tt>xvpbm.c&quot;</tt> to the end of the <tt>&quot;SRCS1
= ...&quot;</tt> macro definition.</p>

<p>Edit the new module.</p>

<p>You'll need to <tt>#include &quot;xv.h&quot;</tt> , of course.</p>

<p>The module should have one externally callable function that
does the work of loading up the file. The function is called with
two arguments, a <i>filename</i> to load, and a pointer to a <tt>PICINFO</tt>
structure, like so:</p>

<pre>/*******************************************/
int LoadPBM(fname, pinfo)
char *fname;   PICINFO *pinfo;
/*******************************************/</pre>

<p>The file name will be the complete file name (absolute, not
relative to any directory). Note: if <i>xv</i> is reading from <tt>stdin</tt>,
don't worry about it. <tt>stdin</tt> is always automatically
copied to a temporary file. The same goes for pipes and
compressed files. Your <tt>Load()</tt> routine is guaranteed that
it will be reading from a real file that appears to be in your
file format, not a stream. This lets you use routines such as <tt>fseek()</tt>
, and such.</p>

<p>The <tt>pinfo</tt> argument is a pointer to a <tt>PICINFO</tt>
structure. This structure is used to hold the complete set of
information associated with the image that will be loaded. When
your <tt>Load()</tt> routine is called, the fields in this
structure will all be zeroed-out. It is your function's
responsibility to load up the structure appropriately, and
completely. The structure is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre><font size="2">/* info structure filled in by the LoadXXX() image reading routines */
 <tt>typedef struct {byte *pic;				 /* image data */
				 int   w, h;			     /* size */
				 int   type;			     /* PIC8 or PIC24 */
				 byte  r[256],g[256],b[256]; /* colormap, if PIC8 */
				 int   normw, normh;	     /* normal size of image.
												normally == w,h except when
												doing quick load for icons*/</tt>
 <tt>			     int   frmType;			 /* def. Format type to save in */
				 int   colType;		     /* def. Color type to save in */
				 char  fullInfo[128];	     /* Format: field in info box */
				 char  shrtInfo[128];	     /* short format info */
				 char *comment;		     /* comment text */
				 int   numpages;		     /* # of page files, if &gt;1 */
				 char  pagebname[64];	     /* basename of page files */
</tt> <tt>} PICINFO; </tt></font></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>The Load()</tt> function should return '1' on success, '0'
on failure.</p>

<p>All other information is communicated using the <tt>PICINFO</tt>
structure. The fields should be setup as follows:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>byte *pic;</tt></dt>
    <dd>This is an array of bytes which holds the returned image.
		The array is <tt>malloc()</tt> 'd by the <tt>Load()</tt>
		routine. The array should be <tt>w*h</tt> bytes long (for
		an 8-bit colormapped image) or <tt>w*h*3</tt> bytes long
		(for a 24-bit RGB image). For an 8-bit image, there is
		one byte per pixel, which serves as an index into the
		returned colormap (see below). For a 24-bit image, there
		are three bytes per pixel, in red, green blue, order. In
		either case, pixels start at the top-left corner, and
		proceed in normal scan-line order. There is no padding of
		any sort at the end of a scan line.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>int w, h;</tt></dt>
    <dd>These variables specify the width and height (in pixels)
		of the image that has been loaded.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>int type;</tt></dt>
    <dd>This variable is used to tell the calling routine whether
		the loaded image is an 8-bit image or a 24-bit image. It <i>must</i>
		be set equal to <tt>PIC8</tt> or <tt>PIC24</tt> ,
		whichever one is appropriate. These constants are defined
		in ' <tt>xv.h</tt> '.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>byte r[256], g[256], b[256];</tt></dt>
    <dd>If the returned image is an 8-bit image, you must load up
		these variables with the colormap for the image. A given
		pixel value in <tt>pic</tt> maps to an RGB color through
		these arrays. In each array, a value of 0 means 'off',
		and a value of 255 means 'fully on'. Note: the arrays do
		not have to be completely filled. Only RGB entries for
		pixels that actually exist in <tt>pic</tt> need to be
		set. For example, if <tt>pic</tt> is known to be a B/W
		bitmap with pixel values of 0 and 1, you would only have
		to set entries '0' and '1' of the <tt>r,g,b</tt> arrays.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>On the other hand, if the returned image is a 24-bit
		image, the <tt>r,g,b</tt> arrays are ignored, and you do
		not have to do anything with them.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>int normw, normh;</tt></dt>
    <dd>These specify the 'normal' size of the image. Normally,
		they are equal to <tt>w</tt> and <tt>h</tt>,
		respectively. The only exception is when doing a 'quick'
		load for icon generation, in which case it may be
		possible to read a 'reduced' version of the image,
		sufficient for generating the tiny icon files. In such a
		case, <tt>w</tt> and <tt>h</tt> would reflect the
		(reduced) size of the image returned, and <tt>normw</tt>
		and <tt>normh</tt> would reflect the 'normal' image size,
		for use in the comments displayed in the <i>xv visual
		schnauzer</i>. Currently only the <tt>LoadJFIF()</tt>
		function in <tt>xvjpeg.c</tt> actually does this. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>int frmType;</tt></dt>
    <dd>This lets you specify the <i>Format</i> type to
		automatically select when you <b>Save</b> a file. As
		such, this is only relevant if you intend to have <i>xv</i>
		write your image format as well as read it. If you are
		only writing an image loader, you should set this field
		to ' <tt>-1</tt> '. On the other hand, if you <i>do</i>
		intend to write a <tt>Write()</tt> function for your
		format, you should edit <tt>xv.h</tt> , find the <tt>F_*</tt>
		format definitions, and add one for your format. See <tt>xvpcx.c</tt>
		for an example of a load-only format, or <tt>xvpbm.c</tt>
		for a load-and-save format.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>int colType;</tt></dt>
    <dd>Used to determine which <i>Colors</i> setting should be
		used by default when you save a file. Since <i>xv</i>
		will use this setting no matter <i>what</i> format you're
		using, you must fill this field in appropriately
		regardless of whether or not you plan to have a <tt>Write()</tt>
		function for your format. This field should be set to <tt>F_FULLCOLOR</tt>
		for any type of color image, <tt>F_GREYSCALE</tt> for
		greyscale images, and <tt>F_BWDITHER</tt> for
		black-and-white 1-bit images. If in doubt, <tt>F_FULLCOLOR</tt>
		is always a safe choice, though it'd be nice if your
		module 'does the right thing'. (For instance if you read
		colormapped images, you should check to see if the
		colormap consists only of shades of grey, and set <tt>F_GREYSCALE</tt>
		if it does.)</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>char fullInfo[128];</tt></dt>
    <dd>This string will be shown in the <i>Format</i> field of
		the <i>xv info</i> window. It should be set to something
		like this:<p><tt>Color PPM, raw format (12345 bytes)</tt></p>
    </dd>
    <dt><tt>char shrtInfo[128];</tt></dt>
    <dd>A 'short' version of the info string. This gets displayed
		in the <i>info</i> line at the bottom of the <i>xv
		controls</i> and <i>xv info</i> windows when the image is
		loaded. It should look like this:</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd><tt>512x400 PPM.</tt></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>char *comment;</tt></dt>
    <dd>If your image file format supports some sort of comment
		field, and you find one in the file, you should <tt>malloc()</tt>
		a pointer to a null-terminated string and copy any and
		all comments into this field. If there are multiple
		comments in a file, you should concatenate them together
		to form one long string. This string <i>MUST</i> be
		null-terminated, as <i>xv</i> will expect to be able to
		use <tt>strlen()</tt> on it, and possibly other 'string'
		functions.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><tt>int numpages; char pagebname[64];</tt></dt>
    <dd>These two fields will only be used if your are writing a <tt>Load()</tt>
		function for a format that may have multiple images per
		file. If your format only ever has a single image per
		file, you don't have to worry about (or do anything with)
		these two fields.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>On the other hand, if your format <i>does</i> do multiple
		images per file, <i>and</i> the current file has more
		than one image in it, then what your program should do is
		<i>split</i> the multi-image file up into a temporary
		collection of single-image files, which should probably
		live in <tt>/tmp</tt> or something. Once you've done so,
		you should return the number of files created in <tt>numpages</tt>
		, and the 'base' filename of the page files in <tt>pagebname</tt>
		. The files created should have a common 'base', with the
		page number appended. (e.g.,
		&quot;/tmp/xvpg12345a.1&quot;,
		&quot;/tmp/xvpg12345a.2&quot;, etc., where
		&quot;/tmp/xvpg12345a.&quot; is the base filename
		(created by the <tt>mktemp()</tt> system function)) You
		should also load the first file and return its image in
		the normal way.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>See the <tt>LoadPS()</tt> function in <tt>xvps.c</tt> for
		a complete example of how this is done. Also, note that
		if your format supports multiple image per file, you
		should also pass in a ' <tt>quick</tt> ' parameter, which
		will tell your function to only load the first 'page' of
		the file. This is used by the <i>visual schnauzer</i>,
		which needs to load images when it generates icon files.
		To speed things up, the <i>schnauzer</i> tells the <tt>Load()</tt>
		function to only load the first page, as that's all it
		need to generate the icon file. </dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="error-handling">Error Handling</a></h3>

<p>Non-fatal errors in your <tt>Load()</tt> routine should be
handled by calling the function <font size="2"><tt>SetISTR(ISTR_WARNING,
&quot;%s: %s&quot;, bname, err)</tt></font>, and returning a zero
value. Where <i>bname</i> is the 'simple' name of your file
(which can be obtained using <tt>BaseName()</tt> function in <tt>xvmisc.c</tt>
), and <i>err</i> should be an appropriate error string.</p>

<p>Non-fatal errors are considered to be errors that only affect
the success of loading this one image, and not the continued
success of running <i>xv</i>. For instance, &quot;can't open
file&quot;, &quot;premature EOF&quot;, &quot;garbage in
file&quot;, etc. are all non-fatal errors. On the other hand, not
being able to allocate memory (unsuccessful returns from <tt>malloc()</tt>
) <i>is</i> considered a fatal error, as it means <i>xv</i> is
likely to run out of memory in the near future anyhow.</p>

<p>Fatal errors should be handled by calling <tt>FatalError(error_string)</tt>
. This function prints the string to <tt>stderr</tt> , and exits
the program with an error code.</p>

<p>Warnings (such as 'truncated file') that may need to be noted
can be handled by calling <tt>SetISTR()</tt> as shown above, but
continuing to return '1' from the <tt>Load()</tt> routine,
signifying success.</p>

<p>Also, if your load routine fails for <i>any reason</i>, it is
your responsibility to <tt>free()</tt> any pointers allocated
(such as the <i>pic</i> field and the <i>comment</i> field, and
return NULL in these fields). Otherwise, there'll be memory leaks
whenever an image load fails.</p>

<h3><a name="hooking-it-up">Hooking it up to </a><strong>xv</strong>
</h3>

<p>Once you have written a <tt>Load()</tt> routine, you'll want
to hook it up to the <i>xv</i> source.</p>

<p>Edit <tt>xv.h</tt> and add a function prototype for any global
functions you've written (presumably just <tt>LoadPBM()</tt> in
this case). Follow the style used for the other <tt>Load*()</tt>
function declarations.</p>

<p>Find the <tt>RFT_*</tt> definitions and tack one on the end
for your format (e.g., <tt>RFT_PBM</tt> ). This is a list of
values that ' <tt>ReadFileType()</tt> ' can return. We'll be
working on that soon enough.</p>

<p>Edit <tt>xv.c</tt> :</p>

<ol>
    <li>Tell the <tt>ReadFileType()</tt> routine about your
		format. Add an 'else-if' case that determines if the file
		in question is in your format. Note that it must be
		possible to uniquely identify your format by reading the
		first 16 characters (or so) of the file. If your file
		format <i>doesn't</i> have some sort of <i>magic number</i>,
		you won't be able to conveniently hook it into <i>xv</i>,
		though you can certainly come up with some sort of
		kludge...</li>
    <li>Tell the <tt>ReadPicFile()</tt> routine about your
		format. Add another <tt>case</tt> for your format type,
		and have it call your <tt>Load()</tt> routine with the
		appropriate arguments.</li>
    <li>Hook your file up into the <i>visual schnauzer</i>. Edit
		the file <tt>xvbrowse.c</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>The first thing you have to do is create a 'generic' icon for
your file format. Copy one of the existing ones (such as ' <tt>bits/br_pbm.xbm</tt>
') to get the size and the general 'look' correct.</p>

<p><tt>#include</tt> this icon at the top of the file.</p>

<p>Add an appropriately-named <tt>BF_*</tt> definition to the end
of the list, and increase <tt>BF_MAX</tt> appropriately.</p>

<p>Have the icon pixmap created in the <tt>CreateBrowse()</tt>
function, by doing something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre><font size="2">bfIcons[BF_PBM] = MakePix1(br-&gt;win, br_pbm_bits,
						   br_pbm_width, br_pbm_height);</font></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Hook your format into the <tt>scanFile()</tt> function. Find
the following code:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre><font size="2">switch (filetype) {
case RFT_GIF:	   bf-&gt;ftype = BF_GIF;      break;
case RFT_PM:	   bf-&gt;ftype = BF_PM;       break;</font></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>And add a case for your format. (To map <tt>RFT_*</tt> values
into their corresponding <tt>BF_*</tt> values.)</p>

<p>Hook your format into the <tt>genIcon()</tt> function. Find
the following code:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre><font size="2">sprintf(str, &quot;%dx%d &quot;, pinfo.w, pinfo.h);
switch (filetype) {
  case RFT_GIF:      if (strstr(pinfo.shrtInfo, &quot;GIF89&quot;))
				       strcat(str,&quot;GIF89 file&quot;);
				     else
				       strcat(str,&quot;GIF87 file&quot;);
  break;
  case RFT_PM:	     strcat(str,&quot;PM file&quot;);  break</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And add a case for your format. This generates an appropriate
info string that gets put in the icon files maintained by the <i>visual
schnauzer</i> (and displayed whenever you click on an icon in the
<i>schnauzer</i> window).</p>

<p>That should do it. Consult the files <tt>xv.h, xv.c,
xvbrowse.c,</tt> and <tt>xvpbm.c</tt> for any further specifics.</p>
