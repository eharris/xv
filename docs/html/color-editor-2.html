<h3><a name="hue-remapping-controls">Hue Remapping Controls</a></h3>

		<td valign="top"><img src="images/fig-111.gif"
		width="201" height="187"></td>
		<td valign="top">These two dials are used to define a
		source and a destination range of hue values. Every hue
		in the source range (defined in the <i>From</i> dial)
		gets mapped to the value of the corresponding point in
		the destination range (defined in the <i>To</i> dial).<p>Each
		dial has a pair of radial lines with handles at their
		ends. Between the two lines an arc is drawn with an arrow
		at one end. The wedge drawn by these lines and the arc
		defines a range of values (in degrees). The direction of
		the arc (clockwise, or counter-clockwise) determines the
		direction of this range of values (increasing or
		decreasing).</p>
		</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Distributed around the dial are tick marks and the letters
'R', 'Y', 'G', 'C', 'B', and 'M'. These letters stand for the
colors Red, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Magenta, and they show
where these colors appear on the circle.</p>

<p>The range is shown numerically below the control. By default
the range is '330 , 30 CW'. This means that a range of values
[330 , 331 , 332 , ... 359 , 0 , 1 , ... 28 , 29 , 30] has been
defined. Note that (being a circle and all) it wraps back to 0
after 359 .</p>

<p>The range can be changed in many different ways. You can click
on the 'handles' at the end of the radial lines and move them
around. If you click inside the dial, but not on one of the
handles, you'll be able to drag the range around as a single
object. There are also 5 buttons below the dial that let you
rotate the range, flip the direction of the range, and
increase/decrease the size of the range while keeping it centered
around the same value.</p>

<p>In its default state, the <i>To</i> dial is set to the same
range as the <i>From</i> dial. When the two dials are set to the
same range, they are effectively 'turned off', and ignored.</p>

<p>An example of hue remapping:</p>

<ol>
    <li>As a simple example of the sort of things you can do with
		the hue remapping control, we'll change the color of the
		3-D fish in the default (xv logo) image without changing
		any other colors in the image. Since the fish are drawn
		using many different shades of pink, you would not want
		to do this with the <i>Colormap Editing</i> tool. It
		would take forever, or at least most of your lunch break.</li>
    <li>Get the default image up on the screen by running <i>xv</i>
		without specifying any filenames on the command line.
		Open up the <i>xv color editor</i> window via the <b>Color
		Editor</b> command.</li>
    <li>Next, click the mouse in the image window and d rag it
		around. You'll find that pixels in the fish bodies have a
		Hue component value of '0' (which corresponds to pure
		red).</li>
    <li>To remap this hue, simply adjust the <i>From</i> dial so
		that its range includes this Hue value. (It probably
		already does, by default.) Then twiddle the <i>To</i>
		dial to remap the hues. If you find more than the fish
		changing color, you can shrink the <i>From</i> range so
		it covers a smaller range of hues. This may help.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the values printed when you are tracking pixel
values in the image are the values <i>before</i> the <i>HSV
Modification</i> tool is applied. For example, the background of
the default image will still claim to be blue, regardless of what
color you may have changed it to. This is so that you know what
Hue value you will need to remap if you want to change its color
again.</p>

<p>If you press the <b>Reset</b> button that is located near the
hue remapping controls, it will effectively disable the hue
remapping by setting the <i>To</i> range equal to the <i>From</i>
range.</p>

<p>Below the hue remapping controls are a group of 'radio
buttons'. You can have up to six different hue remappings
happening simultaneously. Higher numbered mappings take
precedence over lower numbered mappings.</p>

<p>An example of multiple hue remappings:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Draw a <i>From</i> range that is a complete circle. The
		easiest way to do this is to draw a range that is nearly
		a full circle, then click and hold down the 'increase
		range' button located below the <i>From</i> range dial
		until the range stops getting bigger.</li>
    <li>Copy this range to the <i>To</i> range by pressing the <b>Reset</b>
		button.</li>
    <li>Rotate the <i>To</i> range slightly, by either clicking
		and dragging anywhere in the <i>To</i> range dial, or by
		using the 'rotate clockwise' and 'rotate
		counter-clockwise' buttons located below the <i>To</i>
		range.</li>
    <li>You've just built yourself what is effectively a tint
		control.</li>
    <li>Now, suppose, you'd like to adjust the sky color of your
		(tint-modified) image, without affecting anything else.
		Clicking on the sky in the image window reveals that the
		background still has an (original) hue of around 240. To
		modify this hue without affecting anything else, we'll
		need a second hue remapping.</li>
    <li>Click on the <b>2</b> radio button. The dials will change
		to some other default setting. As before, set the <i>From</i>
		range to encompass the value 240, preferably as 'tightly'
		as possible, and set the <i>To</i> range to produce the
		desired background color. Note that since both the sky
		and the ocean are blueish, it may not be possible to
		change the color of one without affecting the color of
		the other.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the six hue remappings are not 'cascaded'. The
output of one remapping is not fed as input into any of the other
hue remappings. The hue remappings always operate on the hue
values in the original image. In this example, if remapping #1
adds 32 to all hue values, thereby mapping the blue background
(value 240) into a purple-blue (value 272), remapping #2 still
sees the background at 240, and can remap it to anything it
likes. Similarly, in the same example, if remapping #1 has mapped
a green-blue color (value 208) into blue (value 240), remapping
#2 will not map this into another color. As far as remapping #2
is concerned, that green-blue is still green-blue.</p>

<p>If it seems complicated, I'm sorry. It is.</p>

<h3><a name="white-remapping-control">The White Remapping Control</a></h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
    <tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="images/fig-112.gif" width="89"
		height="127"></td>
		<td valign="top">In the HSV colorspace, 'white'
		(including black, and all the greys in between) has no
		Hue or Saturation components. As such, it is not possible
		to use the hue remapping controls to change the color of
		white pixels in the image, since they have no 'color' to
		change.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The white remapping control gives you a way to add Hue and
Saturation components to all the whites in the image. It consists
of a movable point in a color dial. The angle of the dot from the
center of the dial determines the Hue component. The distance of
the dot from the center of the dial determines the Saturation
component. The further the dot is from the center of the dial,
the more saturated the color will be.</p>

<p>You can control the white remapping control in several ways.
You can click on the handle and drag it around with the mouse.
There are also four buttons provided under the dial. One pair
allows you to rotate the handle clockwise and counter-clockwise
without changing its distance from the center. The other pair of
buttons lets you change the distance between the handle and the
center without changing the angle.</p>

<p>The current Hue and Saturation values provided by the control
are displayed below the dial. The first number is the Hue
component, in degrees, and the second is the Saturation
component, as a percentage.</p>

<p>There is also a checkbox that will let you turn off the white
remapping control. This lets you quickly compare your modified
'white' with the original white. You can also effectively disable
the white remapping control by putting the handle back in the
center of the control. The easiest way to do this is to click and
hold the 'move towards center' button until the saturation value
gets down to 0%.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Press the <b>Grey</b> button in the <b>Colormap Editing</b>
		tool. This turns all the colors in the image into shades
		of grey.</li>
    <li>Drag the handle in the white remapping control halfway
		down towards the 'R' mark. The Hue and Saturation values
		should be roughly 0 and 50%. The image should now be
		displayed in shades of pink.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="saturation-control">The Saturation Control</a></h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
    <tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="images/fig-113.gif"
		width="102" height="123"></td>
		<td valign="top">The saturation control lets you globally
		increase or decrease the color saturation of the image.
		In effect, it is much like the 'color' control on most
		color televisions.<p>The saturation control is a dial
		that operates exactly like the dials described in &quot;<a
		href="color-editor-1.html#using-dial-controls">Using the
		Dial Controls</a>&quot;. In short, you can click and hold
		down any of the four buttons in the bottom of the control
		to increase or decrease the control's value. You can also
		click on the dial itself and move the pointer around
		directly.</p>
		</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The saturation control has values that range from '-100%' to
'+100%'. At its default setting of '0%', the saturation control
has no effect on the image. As the values increase, the colors
become more saturated, up to '+100%', at which point every color
is fully saturated. Likewise, as values decrease, the colors
become desaturated. At '-100%', every color will be completely
desaturated (i.e., a shade of grey). Note that this control is
applied after the White Remapping control, so if you 'greyify'
the image by completely desaturating it, you will not be able to
color it using the White Remapping control. You could get around
this problem by saving the (now grey) image, and reloading, or
you could simply use the <b>Grey</b> button in the <b>Colormap
Editor</b> instead.</p>

<p>Unless you're trying for some special effects, the useful
range of this control is probably 20%. Also note that the control
will have no effect on shades of grey, as they have no color to
saturate.</p>

<h3><a name="intensity-graph">The Intensity Graph</a></h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
    <tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="images/fig-114.gif"
		width="167" height="149"></td>
		<td valign="top">The <i>Intensity</i> graph allows you to
		change the brightness of the image, change the contrast
		of the image, and get some unique effects.<p>The <a
		name="graph-function"><i>Intensity</i></a> graph is a
		function that lets you remap intensity values (the Value
		component in the HSV Colorspace) into other intensity
		values. The input and output values of this function both
		range from 0 to 255. The input values range along the <i>x
		</i>axis of this graph (the horizontal). For every input
		value (point along the <i>x </i>axis) there is a unique
		output value determined by the height of the graph at
		that point. In the graph's default state, the function is
		a straight line from bottom-left to top-right. In this
		case, each input value produces an equivalent output
		value, and the graph has no effect.</p>
		</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><a name="graph-operating">There</a> are a number of 'handles'
along the graph. These provide your major means of interacting
with the graph. You can move them around arbitrarily, subject to
these two constraints: the handles at the far left and far right
of the graph can only be moved vertically, and handles must
remain between their neighboring handles for the graph to remain
a proper function.</p>

<p>The handles are normally connected by a spline curve. To see
this, move one of the handles by clicking and dragging it. (Note
that the <i>x,y</i> position of the current handle is displayed
while the mouse button is held down.) The function will remain a
smoothly curved line that passes through all the handles. You can
change this behavior by putting the function into 'lines' mode.
Press the <img src="images/fig-115.gif" width="31" height="24">
button. The function will change to a series of line segments
that connect the handles. Press the <img src="images/fig-116.gif"
width="31" height="24"> button to go back to 'spline' mode.</p>

<p>The next two buttons let you add or delete handles. The <img
src="images/fig-117.gif" width="31" height="24"> button will
insert a handle into the largest 'gap' in the function. The <img
src="images/fig-118.gif" width="31" height="24"> button will
remove a handle from the smallest 'gap' in the function. You can
have as few as 2 handles, or as many as 16. Note that as the
number of handles gets large, the spline will start getting out
of control. You may wish to switch to 'lines' mode in this case.</p>

<p>The <img src="images/fig-119.gif" width="31" height="24">
button puts everything back on a straight line connecting
bottom-left to top-right (a 1:1 function). It does not change the
number of handles, nor does it change the <i>x</i> -positions of
the handles.</p>

<p><a name="gamma-correction">The</a> <img
src="images/fig-120.gif" width="31" height="24"> button lets you
set the function curve by entering a single number. The function
is set equal to the gamma function:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>y = 255 * ((i/255)</i> ^ (<i>1/g))</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>where <i>i</i> is the input value (0-255), g is the gamma
value, and <i>y</i> is the computed result (0-255).</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gamma values (for our purposes) are floating point
		numbers that can range between -1000 and 1000,
		non-inclusive.</li>
    <li>A gamma value of '1.00' results in the normal 1:1
		straight line.</li>
    <li>Gamma values of less than 1.00 but greater than 0.00
		result in 'exponential' curves which will dim the image.</li>
    <li>Gamma values greater than 1.00 result in 'logarithmic'
		curves, which will brighten the image. Try it and see.</li>
    <li>Gamma values between 0 and -1 result in reversed
		'exponential' curves.</li>
    <li>Gamma values less than -1 result in reversed
		'logarithmic' curves.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a shortcut for the <img src="images/fig-121.gif"
width="31" height="24"> button. Type <b>g</b> while the mouse is
inside the graph window.</p>

<p>Also, touching any of the handles after a <img
src="images/fig-122.gif" width="31" height="24"> command will put
the graph back into its 'normal' mode. (Either 'spline' or
'lines' depending on which of the top two buttons is turned on.)</p>

<p>Generally, whenever you move a graph handle and let go of it,
the image will be redrawn to show you the effects of what you've
done. This can be time-consuming if you intend to move many
points around. You can temporarily prevent the redisplay of the
image by holding down a <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b> key. Continue to
hold the <b>&lt;shift&gt;</b> key down while you move the handles
to the new position. Release the <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b> key when
you're done, and the image will be redisplayed.</p>
