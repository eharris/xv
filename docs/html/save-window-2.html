    <dd>While <i>xv</i> can read both the GIF87a and GIF89a
		variants of the GIF format, it will normally write
		GIF87a. <i>xv</i> will only write a GIF89a file if there
		are image comments to be saved (comment blocks being a
		GIF89a extension).. This is in keeping with the GIF89
		specification, which states that if you don't need any of
		the features added in GIF89, you should continue to write
		GIF87, for greater compatibility with old GIF87-only
		readers. <p>Since GIF only supports one format (up to 8
		bits per pixel, with a colormap), there will be no file
		size difference between a <b>Full Color</b> and a <b>Greyscale</b>
		image. A <b>B/W Dithered</b> image, on the other hand,
		will be considerably smaller.</p>
		<p>If you are currently in <b>24-bit mode</b> , and you
		are saving in any color mode other than <b>B/W Dithered</b>
		, the currently selected 24-&gt;8 conversion algorithm
		will be used to generate an 8-bit version of the current
		image, and that image will be written. (See &quot;<a
		href="control-window-3.html#bit-menu">The 24/8 Bit Menu</a>&quot;
		for more info.) </p>

    <dd>One minor clarification: 'JPEG' is an image compression
		algorithm, <i>not</i> an image file format. 'JFIF' is a
		file format created by the fine folks at the Independent
		JPEG Group for the storage and interchange of 'JPEG'-ed
		image data. As such, it is the de-facto standard for
		'JPEG' images. So, technically, when folks talk about
		'JPEG' files, what they probably mean is 'JFIF' files,
		but it's not <i>necessarily</i> so. Therefore, it is
		possible to run across 'JPEG' files that <i>xv</i> can't
		read, because they don't adhere to the 'JFIF' file format
		standard. Just thought you'd like to know. <p><b>Full
		Color</b> images are written in a 24-bit RGB format, and <b>Greyscale</b>
		images are written in an 8-bit greyscale format. <b>B/W
		Dithered</b> images should <i>not</i> be used, as they
		will probably wind up being larger than <b>Greyscale</b>
		versions of the same images, due to the way JPEG works.
		Note: You cannot write a <b>Reduced Color</b> JPEG file.
		Trust me, given the method that JPEG uses to compress,
		it's not in your best interest to save <b>Reduced Color</b>
		JPEG files. If you attempt to do so, a <b>Full Color</b>
		JPEG file will be saved. </p>
		<p><a name="jpeg-dialog"><img src="images/fig-181.gif"
		width="414" height="230"> </a></p>
		<p>When you save in the JPEG format, the dialog box shown
		above will pop up and ask you for a quality setting and a
		smoothing value. '75%' is the default quality value, and
		really, it's a fine choice. You shouldn't have to change
		it under normal circumstances. The lower you set the
		quality, the higher the compression ratio will be (i.e.,
		the JPEG file will be smaller). Note that setting the
		quality setting to '100%' will <i>not</i> result in
		'lossless JPEG' (i.e., the original and the JPEG'd images
		will <i>not</i> be exactly the same, just very close). </p>
		<p>The smoothing value is used to 'blur' images before
		saving them. It's often a good idea to blur GIF (and
		other 8-bit color) images before saving them, as you'll
		get better compression that way, and it also may
		partially undo the dithering that been done to many 8-bit
		images. On the downside, you'll also get somewhat blurred
		images. Something you have to decide for yourself.</p>
		<p>Note: The JPEG support in <i>xv</i> is optional. While
		it is normally enabled, it is possible that it may not be
		enabled on your system (due to problems compiling the
		JPEG library, or something). If this is the case, you
		won't have a <b>JPEG</b> selection in the <b>Format</b>
		menu. Please feel free to complain to whomever built the
		binary that you're using. </p>

    <dd><b>Full Color</b> and <b>Reduced Color</b> images are
		written in a 24-bit RGB format, and <b>Greyscale</b>
		images are written in an 8-bit greyscale format. <b>B/W
		Dithered</b> images are written in a 1-bit B/W format.<p><a
		name="tiff-dialog"><img src="images/fig-183.gif"

		<p>When you save in the TIFF format, the dialog box shown
		above will pop up and ask you which type of image
		compression it should use. <b>None</b>, <b>LZW</b>, and <b>PackBits</b>
		compression types are available for use with all the
		Color modes. In addition, there are two <b>B/W Dithered</b>-only
		algorithms, <b>CCITT Group3</b> and <b>CCITT Group4</b> .

    <dd><b>Full Color</b> and <b>Reduced Color</b> images are
		stored in a 24-bit RGB format, <b>Greyscale</b> images
		are stored in an 8-bit greyscale format, and <b>B/W
		Dithered</b> images are stored in a 1-bit B/W format. <p><i>xv</i>
		writes Encapsulated PostScript, so you can incorporate <i>xv</i>-generated
		PostScript into many desktop-publishing programs. <i>xv</i>
		also prepends some color-to-greyscale code, so even if
		your printer doesn't support color, you can still print
		'color' PostScript images. These images will be three
		times larger (in file size) than their greyscale
		counterparts, so it's a good idea to save <b>Greyscale</b>
		PostScript, unless you know you may be printing the file
		on a color printer at some point.</p>
		<p>Also, you should probably never need to generate <b>B/W
		Dithered</b> PostScript, as every PostScript printer I've
		ever heard of can print greyscale images. The only valid
		cases I can think of are: A) doing it for a special
		effect, and B) doing it to generate a much smaller
		(roughly 1/8th the size) PostScript file.</p>
		<p>Note: When you try to save a PostScript file, the <i>xv
		postscript</i> window will pop up to let you specify how
		you want the image printed. (See &quot;<a
		href="postscript-window.html">The PostScript Window</a>&quot;
		for details.) </p>

    <dt><a name="pbmraw"><img src="images/fig-185.gif"

    <dd><b>Full Color</b> images are saved in <b>PPM</b> format. <b>Greyscale</b>
		images are saved in <b>PGM</b> format. <b>B/W Dithered</b>
		images are saved in <b>PBM</b> format. Each of these
		formats are tailored to the data that they save, so PPM
		images are larger than PGM images, which are in turn
		larger than PBM images. <p>In the <b>raw</b> variation of
		the PBM formats, the header information is written in
		plain ASCII text, and the image data is written as binary
		data. This is the more popular of the two dialects of
		PBM, as it produces considerably smaller image files. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-186.gif" width="151" height="16"></dt>
    <dd>Like <b>PBM/PPM (raw)</b>, only the image data is written
		as ASCII text. As such, images written in this format
		will be several times larger than images written in <b>PBM/PGM/PPM
		(raw)</b>. This is a pretty good format for interchange
		between systems because it is easy to parse. Also, since
		they are pure, printable ASCII text, images saved in this
		format can be mailed, without going through a <i>uuencode</i>-like
		program. <p>Note that <i>xv</i>-created PBM files (both <b>raw
		</b>and <b>ascii </b>variants) may break some PBM readers
		that do not correctly parse comments. If your PBM reader
		cannot parse comments, you can easily edit the PBM file
		and remove the comment lines. A comment is everything
		from a &quot;#&quot; character to the end of the line. </p>

    <dt><a name="xbm"><img src="images/fig-187.gif" width="151"

    <dd>Saves files in the format used by the <i>bitmap</i>
		program, which is part of the standard X11 distribution.
		Since bitmap files are inherently 1-bit per pixel, you
		can only select the <b>B/W Dithered</b> option for this
		format. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="xpm"><img src="images/fig-188.gif" width="151"
		height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd>New to <i>xv </i>version 3.10, you can now load and save
		images in the XPM (X PixMap) format. Such files are best
		suited to small-ish images with a small number of colors,
		such as multi-color icons, and the like. One nifty
		feature of this format is that images can be created and
		edited using a text editor. All color choices work as
		expected. One warning: <i>xv</i> will not write out an
		XPM file with more than 256 different colors. If you are
		viewing a 24-bit image and save it as an XPM file, <i>xv</i>
		will first compute an 8-bit version of the image using
		the current 24-&gt;8 conversion algorithm (see &quot;<a
		href="control-window-3.html#bit-menu">The 24/8 Bit Menu</a>&quot;),
		and then save that. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="bmp"><img src="images/fig-189.gif" width="151"
		height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd><i>xv</i> will write a number of different types of BMP
		files depending on the 8/24 bit mode that you're in, the
		number of colors in the image, and the current 'Colors'
		choice. <p>If you are currently in <b>8-bit Mode</b>, and
		you select <b>Full Color</b>, <b>Reduced Color,</b> or <b>Greyscale</b>,
		<i>xv</i> will write out an uncompressed 4- or 8-bits per
		pixel BMP file, based on the number of different colors
		in the current image.</p>
		<p>If you are in <b>24-bit Mode</b> and you select <b>Full
		Color</b>, the program will write out an uncompressed
		24-bits per pixel image.</p>
		<p>If you are in <b>24-bit Mode</b> and you select <b>Greyscale</b>,
		an uncompressed 8-bit per pixel BMP file will be written.</p>
		<p>If you select <b>B/W Dither</b>, a 1-bit per pixel BMP
		file will be written. </p>

    <dd><b>Full Color</b> and <b>Reduced Color</b> images are
		stored in a 24-bit RGB format, <b>Greyscale</b> images

		Dithered</b> images are stored in a 1-bit B/W format. </dd>

    <dd>If you select <b>Full Color</b> or <b>Reduced Color</b> ,
		the program will write a 24-bit image. Otherwise, it will

		height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd>Another new format added to <i>xv</i> version 3.10. <i>xv</i>
		can now read and write 24-bit uncompressed Targa files.
		As such files are about the only reason folks still use
		the Targa format, this shouldn't be a problem. The color
		choices will do what you'd expect, but given that <i>xv</i>
		only reads/writes 24-bit Targa files, saving anything but
		<b>Full Color</b> would be a waste. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="fits"><img src="images/fig-193.gif" width="151"

    <dd>Saves images in the FITS format, a greyscale-only format
		used primarily by astronomers. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="pm"><img src="images/fig-194.gif" width="151"
		height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd>Note: This format is was developed at Penn, and is rarely
		seen outside of Penn. If you don't know anything about
		it, trust me, you don't want to. <p><b>Full Color</b>
		images are saved in the 3-plane, 1-band, PM_C format. <b>Greyscale</b>
		and <b>B/W Dithered</b> images are both saved in the
		1-plane, 1-band, PM_C format. As such, there is no size
		advantage to saving in the <b>B/W Dithered</b> format. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="filename-list"><img src="images/fig-195.gif"
		width="151" height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd>This is not an 'image file format' at all, which is why
		it appears separate from the rest of the formats in the <b>Format
		</b>menu. Instead of saving the current image, what this
		does is save a list of all the filenames in the <i>xv </i>controls
		window file list. This file list can be used in
		conjunction with the '<tt>-flist</tt>' option. See &quot;<a
		href="modifying-behavior-3.html#miscellaneous-options">Modifying
		xv Behavior</a>&quot; for more details. </dd>
