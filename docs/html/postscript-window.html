<h1>The PostScript Window</h1>

<p><a name="postscript-window"><img src="images/fig-196.gif"
width="445" height="380"> </a></p>

<p>The <i>xv postscript</i> window lets you describe how your
image should look when printed. You can set the paper size and
the image size, position the image on the paper, and print in
'portrait' or 'landscape' mode.</p>

<p>The majority of the <i>xv postscript</i> window is taken up by
a window that shows a white rectangle (the page) with a black
rectangle (the image) positioned on it. You can position the
image rectangle anywhere on the page. The only constraint is that
the center of the image (where the two diagonal lines meet) must
remain on the page. Only the portion of the image that is on the
page will actually be printed.</p>

<p>The image can be (roughly) positioned on the page by clicking
in the image rectangle and dragging it around. As you move the
image, the &quot;Top&quot; and &quot;Left&quot; position displays
will show the size of the top and left margins (the distance
between the top-left corner of the page and the top-left corner
of the image).</p>

<p>You'll note that you have limited placement resolution with
the mouse. If you want to fine-position the image, you can use
the arrow keys to move the image around. The arrow keys will move
the image in .001&quot; increments. You can hold them down, and
they will auto-repeat. You can also hold a <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b>
key down while using the arrow keys. This will move the image in
.010&quot; increments.</p>

<p>You can change the size of the printed image by adjusting the <i>Width</i>
or <i>Height</i> dials. Normally, the dials are locked together,
to keep the aspect ratio of the image constant. You can unlock
the dials by turning the off the checkbox located below the
dials. As you change the dials, the size of the image (when
printed) is displayed below, in inches and in millimeters. The
current resolution of the image is also displayed below. The
&quot;Resolution&quot; numbers tell you how many image pixels
will be printed per inch. </p>

		<td valign="top">One note on the 'Resolution' setting: I
		get a fair number of complaints about the default of
		'100% = 72 dpi'. Many folks wonder why they can't set the
		resolution to 300 dpi, given that most PostScript
		printers are 300 dpi. The answer, of course, is that they
		can. While you are constrained to integral percentage
		scaling factors, all the <i>good</i> resolutions (72, 75,
		100, 150, 300, and 600 dpi) are attainable with
		appropriate settings of the scaling factors (100, 96, 72,
		48, 24, and 12%, respectively).</td>
    </tr>

<p>Now, one other thing to note is that, <i>unless</i> you are
printing a black-and-white (not greyscale) image, you almost
certainly do <i>not</i> want to print at 300 dpi (or whatever
your printer's resolution is). At this time, all but the most
enormous and expensive PostScript printers (&gt; $20K) are
fundamentally <i>bitonal</i>. That is, they can either put a dot
at a certain position on a page, or <i>not</i> put a dot there.
They have no ability (or nearly none) to adjust the size or
darkness of the dot. As such, they cannot put an arbitrary 8-bit
shade of gray (or 24-bit RGB color) at each 300 (or 600) dpi
pixel position. They approximate grays (and colors) by dithering
over a larger area. For example, if you print at 75 dpi onto a
300 dpi printer, each arbitrarily colored pixel in your source
image will be represented by a 4x4 grid of bitonal dots on the
page. This is why you should print non-bitonal images at low
resolutions, such as 72 dpi. If you try to print them at higher
resolutions, you will lose shades of gray (or different colors).</p>

<p>Located below the 'page' rectangle are a set of radio buttons
that let you specify the current paper size (8.5&quot;x11&quot;,
8.5&quot;x14&quot;, 11&quot;x17&quot;, A3, A4, B5,
4&quot;x5&quot;, and 35mm), and orientation (Portrait and
Landscape). </p>

<dl>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-198.gif" width="56" height="23"></dt>
    <dd>This button will center the image on the page. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-199.gif" width="56" height="23"></dt>
    <dd>This button will align the bottom-left of the image with
		the bottom-left of the page. (Which is the origin in the
		standard PostScript coordinate system.) This may be
		useful if you are generating Encapsulated PostScript
		files for use in some desktop-publishing package. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-200.gif" width="56" height="23"></dt>
    <dd>This button will make the image as large as possible
		(maintaining half-inch margins on all sides) without
		changing the aspect ratio. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-201.gif" width="172" height="42"></dt>
    <dd>There are a pair of small buttons located next to the
		&quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Top&quot; displays. Clicking
		the &quot;Left&quot; one will cycle between displaying
		the &quot;Left&quot; margin, the &quot;Right&quot;
		margin, and the &quot;Center X&quot; position (the
		distance from the left edge of the paper to the center of
		the image). <p>Clicking the &quot;Top&quot; display's
		button will cycle between displaying the size of the
		&quot;Top&quot; margin, the size of the
		&quot;Bottom&quot; margin, and the &quot;Center Y&quot;
		position (the distance from the top edge of the paper to
		the center of the image). </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="preview"><img src="images/fig-202.gif"
		width="70" height="17"></a></dt>
    <dd>This checkbox lets you specify whether or not to include
		a b/w preview of the image in the PostScript file.
		Certain desktop publishing programs may make use of such
		a preview. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="compress"><img src="images/fig-203.gif"
		width="78" height="17"></a></dt>
    <dd>Specifies whether or not to generate compressed 8-bit per
		pixel PostScript. This is particularly handy if you're
		generating color PostScript, and you are currently in <b>8-bit
		Mode</b>, as color PostScript files are normally three
		times larger than their greyscale counterparts.
		Compression can shrink these color PostScript files by a
		factor of 4:1. It has a lesser effect on greyscale
		images. It should be noted, however, that compressed
		PostScript files may take 2-3 times longer to print than
		uncompressed PostScript files. However, if you are
		connected to your laser printer via a slow 9600 baud
		serial line, the decreased transmission time due to
		compression may make up for the increased execution time.
		Also note that the '<b>compress</b>' checkbox is not
		available when you are in <b>24-bit Mode</b> </dd>
</dl>

<p>Click the <b>Ok</b> button when you're done. If everything is
successful, the <i>xv postscript</i> and the <i>xv save</i>
window will both close. If <i>xv</i> was unable to write the
PostScript file, the <i>xv postscript</i> window will close, but
the <i>xv save</i> window will remain open, to give you a chance
to enter a different filename.</p>
